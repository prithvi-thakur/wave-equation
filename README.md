# wave-equation

Python programs for a variety of wave equations (1D, 2D) with different boundary conditions. Most methods will be finite difference and pseudospectral.

This is mostly as an exercise to teach myself numerical methods and pde.

Run on https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ to look at the animations.
